# Why labels are special

Labels could be treated like any other property, but there is one slight difference.

You can add any key-value pair (like assignee: "Dwight", created: '2020-02-...") as properties.

On the other hand if you would wan't to add any keyless values (like "done", "important"),
labels are excactly that.

Call it labels, tags, or whatever, but it is a designated property for values without keys.
